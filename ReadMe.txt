The HSV colour system is the main feature of this library. It is based on the colour wheel 
and has many exciting possibilities (see docs for info).

The Colour Space library includes:

- Functions to convert between HSV (Hue Saturation Value) & RGB (Red, Green Blue) colour. 
- Functions to extract Red, Green & Blue components from an RGB value & vice versa. 
- NEW - Functions to draw colour bars, brightness bars, colour wheels.
- NEW - Functions to get colour selections from colour bars/wheels so you can make your own 
  palette requesters & colour selection routines!
- Functions to draw colour bars, draw colour wheels, and to get colour selections so you
  can make your own palette requesters & colour selection routines!
- A Function to convert hex strings (i.e. from user input) to integer values. 
- Document: "Why Use HSV?" 
- Three demo programs illustrating some uses of HSV.
